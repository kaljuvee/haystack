## 1. Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) has become a cornerstone of modern technology, powering everything from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles. However, successful ML implementation requires more than just algorithms and dataâ€”it demands a systematic approach that encompasses best practices across the entire ML lifecycle.

This guide provides practical recommendations for organizations and practitioners looking to implement ML solutions effectively and responsibly.

### Key Principles
